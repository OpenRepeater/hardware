OpenRepeater Hardware
========

This is where hardware related files live for the OpenRepeater Project. These are files such as Eagle CAD files for the interface board design for the Raspberry Pi and Beaglebone Black to connect to the radios.

Any Issues should be done under the main repository located at https://github.com/OpenRepeater/OpenRepeater with the appropriate label applied for hardware.
